# TumorClasification
This repository contains code and resources for solving the Tumor Dataset Classification problem using PyTorch, TorchVision, and TorchInfo. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to classify tumor data accurately

## Contents
The tests code and annotations (in spanish) are in Code.ipynb. 

The dataset should be unziped inside a folder named "data" following the structure:
 - data/Dataset_name/...

The different models and pretreained models must be inside the "models" folder.

## Installation

To use the code and run the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- TorchVision
- TorchInfo
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- cuda (and it's necessary dependencies)
